I'd like to try to implement this one without looking at any docs. This will be a minimal version that implements just a few options.  I'm ~~almost positive~~ certain that I will need them. Here goes nothing. This might be a long post.

### try 1
```javascript
// I'll follow ~~the~~ this... eh... implement these things:
// jQuery.ajax(url,settings)
// settings.success
// settings.data
// settings.error
// settings.headers 
// settings.type
var $ = {};
$.ajax = function(url, settings) {
    


}
```
