title: Situational ethics and Popcorn Time 
---

Hacker news has drawn attention to [this](http://www.dn.no/magasinet/2015/09/07/1606/Popcorn-Time/inside-popcorn-time--the-worlds-fastest-growing-piracy-site) article about a new piracy site. Federico Abad, the founder, said, "I wanted to see a movie, but couldn't... I just wanted to solve a problem." Isn't this what situational ethics is? In the name of problem solving, theft is justified. Later, Abad mentions Argentina's slow internet and the arrival delay of new movies to the country as further justification, but there is no justification good enough. Any amount of problem solving that has followed from Abad's creation has been easily offset by the time wasted by movie-watching --at least play video games or something--, the effort spent in shutting down the service, and the money lost by the content creators. To folks who pirate the movies: if you are rich enough to have the time to watch a movie, you have enough money to pay for the movie.
