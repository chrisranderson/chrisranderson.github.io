title: "Volkswagen's root cause"
---

Everyone has heard about [Volkswagen cheating on emissions tests](http://bgr.com/2015/09/23/volkswagen-pollution-test-cheating-diesel/). What is it about their history that brought them to that point? Is their company culture founded on greed? I can't say for certain, but I don't think so: being the second-largest automaker in the world tells me that they have a positive net utility; a lot of people love their products. Instead, I imagine their problem was a few employees who felt things like rounding up hours on their timesheets wasn't all that bad. The acceptance of any unethical behavior grows with practice, and practice makes perfect... or bankrupt. 

My heart aches for the upstanding people at Volkswagen who are reaping what the cheaters sowed; hopefully, they can clean up the company's reputation and keep making products that people love.
